## Overview

The **Loan Approval Prediction Project** utilizes **Decision Trees and Random Forests** to classify loan applicants based on their eligibility. By analyzing financial data, income, and credit history, this project aims to provide a robust predictive model that helps financial institutions assess loan risks efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares loan applicant data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes key trends and relationships.
- **Decision Tree Model**: Establishes baseline predictions for loan approval.
- **Random Forest Model**: Enhances accuracy through ensemble learning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using classification metrics.

## Project Files

### 1. `loan_data.csv`
This dataset contains applicant information, including:
- **Credit Score**: Numerical representation of creditworthiness.
- **Loan Amount**: Amount requested by the applicant.
- **Annual Income**: Reported yearly income.
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Indicator of financial stability.
- **Loan Approval Status**: Target variable (1 = Approved, 0 = Denied).

### 2. `DecisionTree_&_RandomForests_Project.py`
This script conducts data preprocessing, builds classification models, and evaluates performance.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
  - Handles missing values and formats numerical data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Generates histograms, count plots, and box plots.

- **Model Training**:
  - Trains both **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('loan_data.csv')

# Train-test split
X = data[['Credit Score', 'Loan Amount', 'Annual Income', 'Debt-to-Income Ratio']]
y = data['Loan Approval Status']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train models
dt_model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred_dt = dt_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_rf = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Decision Tree Performance:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_dt))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_dt))

print("Random Forest Performance:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_rf))
```
